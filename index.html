      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        In this project, we have explored and implemented additional subdivision schemes: the Butterfly scheme, the
        modified Butterfly scheme, Catmull-Clark scheme, and Doo-Sabin scheme. We built the infrastructure to switch
        between different subdivision schemes, and compare their execution performance.

      <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
      <h3>1. Infrastructure Improvements</h3>

      <h4>1.1 Command Line Flag "-a" to Switch between Subdivision Schemes</h4>
      <p>
        We cloned the code base of Project 2 to get started. But soon we found that the existing code infrastructure
        cannot satisfy our need for multiple subdivision schemes, because it is designed to only support Loop subdivision in
        Project 2. It's very inefficient to switch between different schemes.
      </p>
      <p>
        To overcome this limitation, we added a new flag <b>-a</b> to arguments to determine which subdivision scheme to
        use. For example, one can use command <b>./meshedit -a doo-sabin ../dae/teapot.dae</b> to run Doo-Sabin subdivision
        on scene file teapot.dae.
      </p>
      <p>
        This dramatically improved our efficiency when we work on different subdivision schemes in parallel. It also helps
        us have separation of concerns and make our code modular and more readable.
      </p>

      <h4>1.2 Duration Measurement for Subdivision Executions</h4>
      <p>
        We also added the logic to measure the duration of subdivision/upsampling duration, so that we can easily compare
        the performance difference between different schemes.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Butterfly Subdivision Scheme</h3>
      <p>
        The function <b>MeshResampler::upsampleButterfly( HalfedgeMesh& mesh )</b> implements the Butterfly method for
        subdivision. First, the function iterates through each edge in the mesh and computes the position of the vertex
        that will be added in the middle of that edge during subdivision. The position of this vertex is determined by
        nearby vertices, inspired by slide 65 of
        <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs468-10-fall/LectureSlides/10_Subdivision.pdf" target="_blank">
          http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs468-10-fall/LectureSlides/10_Subdivision.pdf
        </a>
        , where we chose omega to be ⅛. Similar to Loop subdivision, this new position is stored in
        edge->newPosition. After all these new positions have been computed, <b>upsampleButterfly(...)</b> iterates through the
        edges again and adds the new vertices with the new positions to the mesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the new vertices are created, the function needs to create edges between the new vertices, along with the
        corresponding new faces and halfedges. This is the most complicated part of the function, because when iterating
        through the new vertices, there are a few cases to account for: adjacent new vertices may have already been hit
        by the for loop, so some of the new edges, faces, and halfedges may have already been created. Before the
        function returns, it sets all the vertices’ isNew attributes to false.
      </p>
      <p>
        One challenge for the <b>upsampleButterfly(...)</b> was figuring out the order of computations and operations on the
        mesh. The desired subdivision product is simple: split each triangle into four triangles with new vertices
        determined by the positions of surrounding triangles (
        <a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~qin/research/mandal-tvcg2000.pdf" target="_blank">
          https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~qin/research/mandal-tvcg2000.pdf
        </a>
        ). But creating and assigning the mesh elements correctly was more tedious and exacting. The major bugs we had
        were due to accessing a mesh element before it had been correctly assigned.

      <h3>3. Modified Butterfly Subdivision Scheme</h3>
      <p>
        The butterfly subdivision scheme generally produces a smooth surface except at the extraordinary points which
        are vertices with valence != 6.
      </p>
      <p>
        To resolve this issue, we implemented a modified butterfly scheme to obtain better smoothness properties at
        these extraordinary points. To start, all the edges have been categorized into three classes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Edges connecting two vertices of valence 6, where a 10 point stencil is used to obtain the new vertex
          positions, which is shown in the left image below.
        </li>
        <li>
          Edges connecting a vertex of valence 6 and a vertex of valence n != 6, where a different stencil is used,
          shown in the lower right image below, where the weights are defined by
        </li>
        <div class="ui column grid">
          <div class="row centered">
            <div class="five wide column ui">
              <img src="./assets/modified_1.png">
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <li>
          Edges connecting two vertices of valence n != 6. The last case cannot occur except in the initial mesh as all
          newly introduced vertices through this scheme are of valence 6.
        </li>
      </ul>

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        One challenge for implementing Modified Butterfly Subdivision was the complexity of the scheme in general, and
        had the same issues as Butterfly subdivision where creating and assigning mesh elements was very tedious and
        difficult to debug.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Catmull-Clark Subdivision Scheme</h3>
      <p>
        We used the Wikipedia article on Catmull-Clark (
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catmull%E2%80%93Clark_subdivision_surface" target="_blank">
          https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catmull%E2%80%93Clark_subdivision_surface
        </a>
        ) linked in Project 2 of CS184 to implement the algorithm using the following steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Compute the centroid of each face (face point).
        </li>
        <li>
          Compute the edge points for each edge as the average between an edge’s midpoint and neighboring faces’ face
          points.
        </li>
        <li>
          Compute new points for each vertex (vertex points) by taking the average of the sum of neighboring face
          points, two times the neighboring edge midpoints, and the original vertex position. scaled to the degree of
          the vertex minus three.
        </li>
        <li>
          Creating a vertex at the edge point to split the edge, and then connecting the new vertex to the edge’s old
          vertices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Moving the old vertices to their respective vertex points.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make new edges between each face point and the edge points which are now vertices.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One challenge we had for implementing Catmull-Clark was adjusting for triangle meshes. Typically, Catmull-Clark
        subdivision is performed on quadrilateral meshes. However, we had to consider alternative ways to design and
        order the steps of the algorithm.
      </p>
      <h3>5. Doo-Sabin Subdivision Scheme</h3>
      <p>
        Our Doo-Sabin implementation is greatly inspired by article
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~dm/UNC/COMP258/LECTURES/Doo-Sabin.pdf">
          https://www.cs.unc.edu/~dm/UNC/COMP258/LECTURES/Doo-Sabin.pdf
        </a>. To implement this scheme, we take 6 steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Step 1: Calculate the average of all vertices in each face and put its position in the newly added
          <b>averagePosition</b> field in Face class.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 2: Calculate the midpoint of each edge, and put its position in <b>newPosition</b> field in Edge class.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 3 (Case 1 in below picture): Calculate the positions of new vertices using the positions calculated in
          step 1 and 2. For each
          old vertex, the position of the new vertex is the average of these 4 points: the old vertex, the midpoint of
          the two edges (generated in step 2), and the average face point (generated in step 1). And connect the new
          vertices in each face.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 4 (Case 2 in below picture): Add the connections across old edges. For each old edge, we connect the 4
          new vertices (2 on each
          face), and form a face.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 5 (Case 3 in below picture): Re-connect edges surrounding each old vertex.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 6: Delete all old components (vertices, edges, faces, boundaries) in the mesh.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The challenge of implementing Doo-Sabin scheme is how to connect the half edges to properly form the new faces.
        This is especially true for Case 3 where the half edges have been created in previous steps, and we need to
        somehow figure out the sequence of all such half edges and connect them in a particular order. What we did is to
        maintain a vertex to half edge map, and for each old vertex, iteratively find the next half edge based on the
        endpoint of the current half edge.
